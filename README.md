# PHP De-populator (Object-to-Array)

PHP Depopulator is a simple Object-to-Array library which transforms any objects with getters into an array.
This is **not** a serializer. If you're looking for a serializer/deserializer, I advise you to use [**jms/serializer**](https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer).
